About the enclosures

These enclosures were designed by Oliver, DL4KA. You'll find two versions, one for use without a display and one for use with. The enclosures consist of various parts, notably a main body and two front panels for the rear and the back. For the version with display, there is also a transparent window, which protects the LCD screen.

You can print these items yourself or have them printed at some facility, depending on your preference.

For the enclosure without screen, you can also have alumimium front panels. These you'll find in the main directory under "covers" and are actually KiCad files. You can have these produced at some PCB producing facility that can produce PCBs made of aluminium.
